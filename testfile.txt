Gareth Southgate's side thrashed Ukraine 4-0 in front of a small number of England fans in Rome.

Covid travel restrictions meant fans in the UK were told not to travel to the game in Italy's capital - but all four goals were celebrated loudly by Europe-based England fans inside Stadio Olimpico.

There were extra police patrols outside the ground to deter fans from the UK from getting in.

Instead, expats from mainland Europe managed to get tickets so England's players felt at home.

These nights bring together families, communities, said England boss Gareth Southgate.
